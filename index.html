					  <h4>What is it?</h4>

					    	<li>Functional language from 1980's telecom giant Ericsson</li>
					    	<li>Needed to build systems that were distributed, fault-tolerant, capable of live updates.</li>
					    	<li>Created a new functional, dynamic-but-strongly typed langage(sounds familiar!)</li>
					    	<li>Runs on it's own VM, like Java on the JVM</li>
					    	<li>After toiling in relative obscurity for a decade or so, open sourced the language in the late 90's and now Erlang developers...</li>

					  <h2>Why Elixir</h2>
					  <h4>If Elixir is so similar to Erlang, why invent a new language?</h4>
					  <aside class="notes">
					    <ul>
					      <li>So Elixir runs on the EVM and "feels" like Erlang.</li>
					      <li>Why a new language?</li>
					      <li>First off - nicer syntax</li>
					      <li>Erlang's syntax is Prolog based, so it's a little... weird.</li>
					    </ul>

				  </section>
				  <section>
				    <h3>Macro-based metaprogramming</h3>
				    <ul>
					    <li>Most of Elixir is implemented via macros</li>
					    <li>Great for making your own DSLs</li>
					    <li>Elixir is homoiconic (lisp weenie alert!)
				    </ul>
				  </section>
				  <section>
				    <h3>Awesome tooling</h3>
				    <ul>
				      <li>'mix' is a tool like Leiningen, Rake, Bundler in one</li>
				      <li>ExUnit built-in testing framework</li>
				      <li>Hex package manager, like RubyGems/Maven/NuGet</li>
				      <li>IEx is Elixir's REPL</li>
				      <li>Documentation support is baked-in. Generate module/function documentation with <strong>@moduledoc</strong> and <strong>@doc</strong> attributes, viewable in browser and in IEx.</li>
				    </ul>
				    <aside class="notes">
				      <ul>
				        <li>Huge advantage over not just Erlang but <em>most</em> languages</li>
				        <li>Tools are available right out-of-the-box. Good third-party tools get assimilated.</li>
				        <li>Mix does builds, tests, pulls dependencies, runs other tasks.</li>
				        <li>Fact that tools are a priority means being an Elixir beginner is way more pleasant.</li>
				        <li>Windows, OS X, Linux are all first-class citizens.</li>

				  	<h3>A thoughtful standard library</h3>
				  	<p>
				  	Commonly-used types like Tasks, Streams, and Enumerables are built into Elixir, rather than bolted-on through other libraries.
				  	</p>
				  	<p>
				  	Since Elixir's standard library was <em>designed</em>, rather than <em>grown</em>, it's very consistent.
				  	</p>
				  	<aside class="notes">
				  	  <ul>
				  	    <li>"Bigger" language than Erlang - could be bad, but it's not.</li>
				  	    <li>After a couple of decades of Erlang use, better idea of what developers wish was built-in.</li>
				  	    <li>Task example - Like a promise. Wraps "async_call" and "yield" functions found in Erlang's rpc module, but uses "async/await" semantics from F#.</li>
				  	    <li>Consistent means all Enum module functions take an Enumerable as the first argument. Likewise with Strings, etc.</li>

					  <h2>Parallel</h2>
					  <p>Erlang was built for concurrency, by running on the Erlang VM, Elixir gets concurrency (<em>and parallelism</em>) for free.</p>

					      <li>Erlang was originally designed for telephone switching equipment handling lots of simultaneous phone calls</li>
					      <li>Needed a system that could "multi-task" easily and reliably.</li>
					      <li>But it was the 80's so Intel wasn't giving out free bonus CPU cores with every processor like today</li>
					      <li>Erlang was built for concurrency, not parallelization</li>
					      <li>But because the concurrency system was smartly-design, now we get parallelism basically for free.</li>

					  <h3>Trust the Process</h3>
					  <p>The basic unit of concurrency in Elixir is the <strong>Process</strong></p>
					  <ul>
					    <li>Not an OS Process</li>
					    <li>Lightweight - initially consumes ~300 words of memory and grows as needed.</li>
					    <li>Erlang VM creates one process <em>scheduler</em> per core, load balances processes among schedulers.</li>
					    <li>Processes are scheduled pre-emptively, not cooperatively.</li>
					  </ul>
					  <aside class="notes">
					    <ul>
					      <li>Multi-processing in Elixir is achieved, appropriately enough, with multiple processes</li>
					      <li>Elixir processes are not OS processes, lighter than even threads</li>
					      <li>More akin to JVM's "green threads"</li>
					      <li>Erlang VM creates one scheduler per core, balances processes between schedulers.</li>
					      <li>This also includes schedulers on other machines -- processes can be easily distributed over the network</li>
					      <li>Application should work equally well on a single-core or many-core machine</li>
					      <li>Scheduled pre-emptively, misbehaving processes won't hog CPU or hang the system</li>
					      <li>Contrasted to cooperative scheduling in Node.js or Go.</li>
